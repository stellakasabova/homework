<h2 class="head">What IS a constellation?</h2>
<p class="par">In astronomy, the term <em>constellation</em> actually regers to the area within a boundry drawn around that section of the sky, not the actual group of stars recognizable to the naked eye (Astronomers call them <em>asterisms</em>). Many-if not most-constellations contain asterisms of the same name.<br><br>The constellations serve us a sort of map; we have assigned every star visable from Earth to a constellation. Other space phenomena are assigned to constellations as well-an astrophysicist might refer to a "nebula in the constellation of Taurus". Even though we can't see these deep-space objects with our naked eye, we can locate the boundaries of their constellations.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head">The Ecliptic</h2>
<p class="par">The unique path drawn across the sky by the planets and the moon at night, and by the sunduring the day, is called the <em>ecliptic</em>. I foyu traced an imagenery line across that path on a star map, it would cross through thirteen constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Ophiuchus, Saggitarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. All but Ophiuchus, which only barely touches the ecliptic, are fimiliar to us as the twe;ve signs of the Western astrology, and are also known as the <em>constellations of the zodiac</em>.</p>

<h2 class="head" id="aries">Aries</h2>
<p class="par"><em>Aries</em> is depicted in Ptolemy's system as a ram, and Ancient Engyptian astronomy associated it with a ram-headed god. Ptolemy was likely influenced by these depictions, but Aries has also been said to represent the ram with golden fleece that Jason and the Argonauts quested for in Greek mytgology. The constellation Aries contains a number of distant galaxies, including some so close to one another that their gravitational fields have started to collide(the same way our <em>Milky Way</em> galaxy might one day collide with our neighbouring galaxy <em>Andromeda</em>). Aries' brightest star is <em>Alpha Arietis</em>. Its alternative name, <em>Hamal</em>, comes from the Arabic for "the head of the ram".</p>

<h2 class="head" id="taurus">Taurus</h2>
<p class="par"><em>Taurus</em> is usually shown on star maps head-on, with only his front legs, chest, and head visible. It is home to two prominent star clusters: the <em>Pleiades</em> and the <em>Hyades</em>. The Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, form the star cluster most visible to the naked eye(the seven stars where once considered a constellation). The Hyades were the five daughers of Atlas-the Titan who carried the world on his shoulders in Greek mythology-and half-sisters to the Pleiades. Taures' brightest star is <em>Alpha Tauri</em>, or <em>Aldebaran</em>, comes from the Arabic word for "to follow", because Aldebaran rises and sets after the Pleiades, following them across the sky.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="head" id="gemini">Gemini</h2>
<p class="par">The word "genimi" is Latin for "twins". The mythological twins it is usually assosiated with are <em>Castor</em> and <em>Pollux</em>, which are also the names of the constellation's two brightest stars. In Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux were the twin sons of Zues, and siblings of Helen of Troy. They are commonly depicted holding hands or with thier arms around one another. Gemini serves as a locator for the <em>Geminids</em>, a prominent meteor shower that occurs annually in December when the Earth passes through a trail of dust in the wake of an asteroid called <em>3200 Phaethon</em>. During a Geminids shower, it is possible to see as many as a hundred meteors in an hour.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="head" id="cancer">Cancer</h2>
<p class="par">The word "cancer" comes from the Latin for "crab". The constellation is very dim compared to other star groupings-it's actually the dimmest of all constellations of the zodiac. Ancient humans gave it the name and story anyway, probably to fill the gap along the ecliptic between its brighter neighbours, Gemini and Leo. Cancer is home to one of the closest open clusters to our solar system: <em>Messier 44</em>, nicknamed the <em>Beehive Cluster</em>. This grouping of stars is visible as a nebulus blur with the naked eye, so even ancient astronomers could see it. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei observed the Beehive with a telescope and was able to identify 40 individual stars. Today, we know that the Beehive contains over a thousand stars. The name of Camcer's brightest star, Beta Cancri or Altarf, is Arabic for "the edge".</p>

<br>
<h2 class="head" id="Leo">Leo</h2>
<p class="par"><em>Leo</em> is connected with two mythological stories. In one, it is the <em>Nemean lion</em>, which Hercules hunted and skinned, thereafter wearing the skin. In the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, Leo itself was the hunter, whose bloody jaws led Pyramus to mistakenly believe his lover had been killed. The constellation contains many bright stars and is a locator for the <em>Leonids</em>, one of the most abundant of our annual meteor showers. The name of the constellation's brighest star, <em>Regulus</em>(or <em>Alpha Leonis</em>), comes from the Latin for "the prince".</p>
<img src="leo20.jpg" alt="The constellation 'Leo'" width="340px;" height="340px;">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="head" id="virgo">Virgo</h2>
<p class="par"><em>Virgo</em> is the second-largest constellation in the sky, suprassed in size only by <em>Hydra</em>, and its name is Latin for "virgin". Virgo is tycally depicted as the Greek goddess of agriculture and fertility, <em>Demeter</em>. Virgo contains the Virgo Cluster, a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies. And it's also the namesake of the <em>Virgo Supercluster</em>, the supercluster of galaxies that our own <em>Milky Way</em> belongs to. On star maps, Virgo is often shown with a stalk of wheat or grass in her arms, and the name of its brightest star, <em>Spica</em>(or <em>Alpha Virginis</em>), is Latin for "ear"(likw the aer of corn). Spica is actually a <em>binary star system</em>, but its two component stars orbit each other so closely that they are difficult to resolve as separate stars even with the use of a telescope.</p>
